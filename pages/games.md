## Games

### Personal Projects:

#### Unnamed strategy game:

I started creating a game in Java just to kinda see what I could come up with, and began to take shape into a potententially cool game, so I stuck with it for a while. It is still in a very early stage, using pretty bad pixelart graphics I create on the go. I'm looking forward having a little more time to develop it in the near future. It has a very basic UI with which to create buildings and characters. This characters behave autonomously depending on their role and cooperate to generate and manage resources.

#### Code Defender:

I used to love making little games in blocks based programming languages like Scratch back in the day. I believe it is a great way to start programming at any age. The greatest drawback is that you aren't learning a language that's actually used in the real world. That's why I created Code Defender as part of my Undergraduate Thesis Project. Code Defender is an Augmented Reality game where you control a little robot using a block based version of Java in order to beat each one of the 60 different levels, where the player will learn gradually the fundamentals of programming in Java.

### Projects I took part in:

#### Part-Time Hero

Multiplayer and singer player game. It is a competitive team game where the player will have to cooperate with his/her partner to manufacture a series of orders from the resorces provided by the conveyor belts. This resources and some of the tools are shared across all the players so... keep an eye on your stuff! Anything goes as long as you win: from stealing and sabotaging to casting monsters from beyond and other crazy powerups.

#### AntNest:

This project has a very self-explainatory name. We used behaviour trees and other techniques to conduct an anthill from its beginning all the way to becoming a huge colony with multiple anthills. The user can switch between different views and tweak settings that affect the environment.
