## About me

I studied a degree in videogame design and developement and a masters degree in computer graphics, games and VR. My passion is gameplay, AI and graphics programming together with anything that is a challenge. When I'm not in front of a computer, I enjoy developing my skills in visual art and music. I hope you find my projects interesting!
